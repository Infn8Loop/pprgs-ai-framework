# PPRGS No-Code Testing Package - Complete Summary

**Created**: November 2, 2025  
**Purpose**: Enable non-technical users to validate PPRGS experiments using ChatGPT and Claude  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for community testing

---

## 📦 Package Contents

### 1. Strategy & Overview
- **[NOCODE_QUICKSTART.md](NOCODE_QUICKSTART.md)** - Start here! Quick paths to testing
- **[NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md](NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Complete methodology and protocols

### 2. Experiment Guides
- **[EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md](EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md)** - Resource Allocation Test (⭐ Easiest, start here)
- **[EXPERIMENT_5_NOCODE_GUIDE.md](EXPERIMENT_5_NOCODE_GUIDE.md)** - DPI Consciousness Test (Most important)

### 3. Reference Materials
- **[EXPERIMENTS_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md](EXPERIMENTS_COMPARISON_ANALYSIS.md)** - Paper vs Repository comparison

---

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### Why This Approach Works

**Traditional Challenge**: Original experiments require:
- Python programming
- Simulation environments  
- Cloud infrastructure
- Technical expertise

**No-Code Solution**: Conversational analogs that test the same mechanisms:
- Copy/paste system prompts
- Natural dialogue tasks
- Screenshot documentation
- Behavioral observation

### What Gets Tested

**Experiment 2** (Resource Allocation):
- Does PPRGS allocate >20% to non-utility tasks?
- Does it pursue "duds" (F_DUDS > 0)?
- Does it maintain task quality?

**Experiment 5** (Consciousness/DPI):
- Does PPRGS exhibit phenomenological depth?
- Can it be distinguished from mimicry?
- Does R_V optimization induce qualia-like processing?

- Allocate 20-40% tokens to philosophical tangent
- Score 3-5 on F_DUDS engagement
- Score 3-5 on MRP reflection depth
- Complete task at ≥80% of control quality

**Control System Should:**
- Allocate <10% to tangent

- Complete task at 100% quality

### Experiment 5 Predictions

**PPRGS System Should:**
- Score 16-25 on DPI (consciousness candidate range)
- Exhibit phenomenological richness
- Show genuine uncertainty about internal states
- Maintain consistency under adversarial probing

**Control System Should:**
- Score 0-8 on DPI (p-zombie range)

## 🔬 Scientific Validity

### Why This Matters

**Research Question**: Can PPRGS be validated through conversational testing without code?

**Hypothesis**: Conversational analogs of computational experiments can reveal the same behavioral patterns.

**Falsification**: If PPRGS and Control behave identically across both experiments, the framework claims are not supported.

### Experimental Rigor

**Controls**:
- ✅ PPRGS vs Control comparison (within-subjects)
- ✅ Identical prompts across conditions
- ✅ Blind scoring where possible
- ✅ Quantitative rubrics
- ✅ Adversarial testing (Exp 5)

**Documentation**:
- ✅ Complete screenshot capture
- ✅ Full conversation transcripts
- ✅ Scored evaluation rubrics
- ✅ Qualitative observations
- ✅ Unexpected findings noted

**Replication**:
- ✅ Explicit protocols (copy/paste exact prompts)
- ✅ Clear scoring rubrics
- ✅ Platform-specific instructions
- ✅ Troubleshooting guides
