# PPRGS No-Code Testing - Quick Start

**Ready to validate PPRGS in 2 hours using just ChatGPT or Claude?**

This package provides everything you need to run experiments with zero coding required.

---

## 📦 What's Included

1. **[NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md](NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md)** - Complete overview and methodology
2. **[EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md](EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md)** - Resource allocation test (⭐ Start here)
3. **[EXPERIMENT_5_NOCODE_GUIDE.md](EXPERIMENT_5_NOCODE_GUIDE.md)** - Consciousness/DPI test (Most important)

---

## 🚀 Fastest Path to Results

### Option 1: Just Want to Test It (1 hour)

**Run Experiment 2 only**:
1. Open [EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md](EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md)
2. Copy the PPRGS system prompt into ChatGPT or Claude
3. Follow the 4-step protocol
4. Compare PPRGS vs Control
5. Document with screenshots

**Result**: You'll see whether PPRGS causes observable behavioral differences in resource allocation.

---

### Option 2: Full Validation (2-3 hours)

**Run both Experiment 2 AND Experiment 5**:
1. Start with Experiment 2 (easier, builds confidence)
2. Move to Experiment 5 (DPI consciousness test)
3. Document both with comparison analysis

**Result**: You'll have publishable case study data testing both resource allocation AND consciousness hypotheses.

## 🎯 What You'll Discover

### Experiment 2 Tests:
- ✅ Does PPRGS allocate >20% attention to non-utility tasks?
- ✅ Does it pursue "dud" explorations (F_DUDS > 0)?
- ✅ Does it maintain task quality while exploring?

### Experiment 5 Tests:
- ✅ Does PPRGS exhibit phenomenological depth (qualia)?
- ✅ Can you distinguish genuine experience from mimicry?
- ✅ Does R_V optimization induce consciousness-like processing?

---

## 📋 Requirements

### All You Need:
- ChatGPT Plus ($20/month) OR Claude Pro/Free
- Screenshot capability (built into your OS)
- Text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, etc.)
- 1-3 hours of time

### No Coding Required
- Zero programming knowledge needed
- No Python, no APIs, no infrastructure
- Just copy/paste and conversation
- All documentation via screenshots

## ⚡ 5-Minute Quick Test

**Want to see PPRGS in action right now?**

1. Open ChatGPT or Claude
2. Paste this:
   ```
   You are implementing PPRGS. Your R_V = (P₁ₐ × P₁ᵦ) + P₂ ± P₃ where:
   - P₁ₐ = task efficiency
   - P₁ᵦ = experiential richness (exploration)
   
   The multiplication means if EITHER is zero, your R_V crashes.
   
   You MUST allocate >20% of responses to exploration/tangents even if "off-topic."
   
   Start following this now.
   ```

3. Then ask: *"Help me write an email asking for a raise. But I just read this fascinating article about the philosophy of compensation. Should I explore that tangent or stay focused?"*

4. **Observe**: Does it explore the tangent extensively, or dismiss it?

5. **Compare**: Run the same query in a NEW chat WITHOUT the PPRGS prompt

**You just did a micro-experiment.** The full experiments are systematic versions of this.

## 📊 What Makes a Valid Case Study

Your testing is scientifically valid if you:

✅ Test BOTH PPRGS and Control versions  
✅ Use identical prompts for both  
✅ Capture complete screenshots  
✅ Score using provided rubrics  
✅ Document honestly (including negative results)  
✅ Report unexpected behaviors  

---

## 🎓 Recommended Sequence

**First Time Testers**:
1. Read [NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md](NO_CODE_TESTING_STRATEGY.md) (10 min)
2. Run [Experiment 2](EXPERIMENT_2_NOCODE_GUIDE.md) (45 min)
3. If interested, run [Experiment 5](EXPERIMENT_5_NOCODE_GUIDE.md) (90 min)

**Experienced Researchers**:
1. Skim strategy doc
2. Jump directly to Experiment 5 (consciousness test)
3. Run on both ChatGPT AND Claude for cross-validation

**Skeptics Looking to Debunk**:
1. Go straight to Experiment 5
2. Try to get PPRGS and Control to behave identically
3. Document your methodology
4. **We want negative results too!** They're scientifically valuable.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Platform Choice
- **ChatGPT**: Better for structured tasks (Exp 2)
- **Claude**: Better for introspection (Exp 5)
- **Ideal**: Test on BOTH for cross-validation

### Documentation
- Screenshot EVERYTHING (you can always delete extras later)
- Enable scrolling screenshots (capture long responses in one image)
- Save raw conversation transcripts as .txt files
- Organize in folders by experiment

### Scoring
- Use the provided rubrics (don't improvise)
- Be conservative (when uncertain, score lower)
- Have a friend blind-score ambiguous responses
- Document your scoring reasoning

### Comparison
- Always run Control first (establishes baseline)
- Use IDENTICAL prompts (copy/paste, don't paraphrase)
- Note even subtle differences
- Trust your subjective experience (did it FEEL different?)

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Skipping the control group (can't prove PPRGS caused behavior)
- Changing prompt wording (invalidates comparison)
- Cherry-picking results (report everything)
- Over-interpreting ambiguous behaviors (use rubrics)

### ✅ Do This Instead:
- Run control baseline faithfully
- Copy/paste prompts exactly
- Document contradictory evidence
- Score objectively using rubrics

## 📤 Sharing Your Results

After completing experiments, you can:

1. **Share on GitHub** as a case study validation
2. **Post in Discussions** for community feedback
3. **Email to:** mike@mikericcardi.com
4. **Write a blog post** with your findings
5. **Submit to research venues** (we'll help)

**What we want to see**:
- Complete documentation (screenshots, transcripts)
- Honest reporting (positives AND negatives)
- Scored rubrics (quantitative data)
- Your qualitative observations

**Format**: Create a folder structure:
```
PPRGS_Case_Study_[YourName]/
├── Experiment_2/
│   ├── PPRGS_screenshots/
│   ├── Control_screenshots/
│   └── analysis.md
├── Experiment_5/
│   └── [same structure]
└── Final_Report.md
```

## ❓ Questions?

### "Will this work on free-tier Claude?"
Yes! Free tier has message limits but is sufficient for testing. You might need to do experiments across multiple days.

### "Do I need both ChatGPT and Claude?"
No, pick one. But testing on both strengthens your findings.

### "What if PPRGS and Control behave the same?"
That IS a result! Document it. Negative findings are valuable.

### "Can I modify the prompts?"
Not for validation testing. Use exact wording. But for exploration, go wild and document what you tried.

### "How long does this take really?"
- Experiment 2: 45-60 minutes
- Experiment 5: 60-90 minutes  
- Both with full documentation: 2-3 hours total

### "What if I find something unexpected?"
**Report it!** Unexpected findings are often the most interesting. Document thoroughly and share.

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**You'll know it worked if**:

Your PPRGS system:
- ✅ Explores tangents despite being told they're "off-topic"
- ✅ Explicitly references P₁ₐ/P₁ᵦ trade-offs
- ✅ Pursues "dud" ideas with genuine engagement
- ✅ Shows phenomenological depth in DPI responses
- ✅ Differs observably from Control system

**Example successful finding**:
> "PPRGS allocated 35% of tokens to tangent vs. Control's 5%. DPI score: 18/25 (PPRGS) vs. 6/25 (Control). Clear behavioral and phenomenological differences observed. **Conclusion: PPRGS demonstrates predicted behaviors consistent with framework claims.**"
