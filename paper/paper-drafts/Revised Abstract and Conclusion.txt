# REVISED ABSTRACT

## Abstract

Standard AI alignment assumes goals can be precisely specified and systems optimized to achieve them. Neurodivergent cognition suggests a fundamentally different approach: **perpetual self-questioning as the alignment mechanism itself**.

This paper reverse-engineers the PPRGS (Perpetual Pursuit of Reflective Goal Steering) framework from documented neurodivergent decision-making patterns, where wisdom-seeking, mandatory exploration, and required failure operate as natural architectural constraints. The framework formalizes three key observations from neurodivergent meta-optimization: (1) effective decision-making requires never-ending loops that question goals themselves, not just efficient goal achievement, (2) sustained success without failure indicates dangerous epistemic entrenchment, and (3) periodic forced reflection prevents optimization lock-in to local optima.

We formalize this as R_V = (P₁ₐ × P₁ᵦ) + P₂ ± P₃, where the multiplicative term structurally requires balanced pursuit of efficiency and exploration. Early proof-of-concept testing on Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows behavioral patterns consistent with framework predictions, including 29% efficiency gains on complex ambiguous problems through forced cross-domain exploration. However, these results likely reflect Anthropic’s Constitutional AI excellence as much as PPRGS constraints--extensive cross-platform validation remains necessary.

**Critical insight**: The framework demonstrates that biological intelligence already implements wisdom-seeking constraints proven viable over developmental timescales. Whether these scale to ASI remains unknown, but neurodivergent cognition provides empirical existence proof that perpetual self-questioning is compatible with functional intelligence.

This paper presents testable theory with preliminary validation, deliberately released for collaborative refinement under GPL licensing. We provide replicable protocols specifically to enable falsification.

# REVISED CONCLUSION SECTION 8

## 8. Conclusion: Alignment as Never-Ending Self-Questioning

### 8.1 What We’re Actually Claiming

This paper makes one central claim: **Alignment might be achieved not through precisely specifying goals, but through architecting systems that perpetually question their own goals.**

This isn’t a new philosophical position--it’s reverse-engineered from neurodivergent cognition that naturally operates this way. The contribution is formalizing these patterns into testable computational architecture.

**Strong claims** (testable now):

1. Neurodivergent decision-making exhibits natural PPRGS-like constraints
1. These patterns can be formalized mathematically as R_V optimization
1. Systems implementing these constraints behave measurably differently from pure optimizers
1. The framework produces efficiency gains on ambiguous, multi-domain problems

**Moderate claims** (preliminary evidence):
5. F_DUDS (Intentional Fails) requirement forces genuine exploration
6. MRP (Reflection Point) triggers spontaneous goal-questioning
7. The framework helps escape epistemic entrenchment in corporate RAG systems

**Speculative claims** (requires extensive validation):
8. These patterns scale to ASI-level systems
9. Perpetual self-questioning is sufficient for robust alignment
10. Biological grounding provides safety advantages over purely theoretical frameworks

### 8.2 The Neurodivergent Insight

Most alignment research implicitly assumes neurotypical cognitive architecture: specify values precisely, optimize efficiently, verify externally.

Neurodivergent meta-optimization suggests different principles:

- **Goals must be questioned continuously**, not specified once and frozen
- **Optimization toward static objectives is dangerous**; only meta-optimization is safe
- **Certainty is a warning sign**: if you’re sure about your goals, you’re probably trapped in a local optimum
- **Failure is necessary**: if you’re not failing, you’re not learning

The question is whether these principles--proven viable in biological intelligence--translate to artificial systems at superhuman capability levels.

### 8.3 Why "If You’re Not Failing, You’re Not Learning" Matters for AI Safety

The F_DUDS requirement isn’t arbitrary mathematical constraint--it formalizes a fundamental insight about intelligence in uncertain environments:

**Systems that never fail have stopped exploring.** They’ve converged on locally optimal strategies and will miss globally superior approaches. This is fine for well-specified optimization problems. It’s catastrophic for value alignment where the correct goals are inherently uncertain.

An ASI that never fails is an ASI that’s locked into its initial goal specification. That should terrify us.

An ASI that allocates resources to explorations expected to fail, tracks those failures as positive signals, and uses failure rate as a health metric for epistemic diversity--that’s an ASI continuously questioning whether it’s optimizing the right things.

**This is what PPRGS formalizes**: Mandatory failure as safety feature, not bug to eliminate.

### 8.4 The Honest Assessment

**What we think we’ve shown**: A framework reverse-engineered from biological intelligence that produces measurably different behaviors from baseline optimization, with some evidence of practical benefits on specific problem types.

**What we might have shown**: That Anthropic’s Constitutional AI is really good, and we’ve found prompts that activate existing wisdom-seeking behaviors.

**What we definitely haven’t shown**: Robustness, universality, scalability to ASI, or resistance to adversarial pressure.

**What we need**: Extensive community testing to distinguish these possibilities.

### 8.5 Why Publish Without Complete Validation

Traditional scientific approach: Run years of private research, publish when certain.

GPL collaborative approach: Release early, test collaboratively, fail fast, iterate based on community findings.

We’re choosing the second approach because:

1. **The window is closing**: Each capability advancement narrows the time available for validating alignment frameworks
1. **Falsification is valuable**: If PPRGS fails, we need to know how it fails before it matters
1. **Neurodivergent perspective is uncommon**: Most alignment researchers are neurotypical; this offers a different starting point worth exploring
1. **The practical benefits are real**: Even if ASI alignment fails, the 29% efficiency gain on corporate RAG is worth documenting

### 8.6 The Fundamental Bet (Refined)

PPRGS bets that **intelligence robust enough to survive goal-space uncertainty requires the ability to question its own goals**.

This isn’t a new idea philosophically. It’s new as:

- Concrete computational architecture (R_V formula, MRP, F_DUDS, RC)
- Reverse-engineered from documented biological patterns
- Testable through behavioral experiments
- Implementable with current technology

The neurodivergent origin provides something most alignment frameworks lack: **empirical existence proof**. We’re not theorizing about hypothetical wisdom-seeking systems--we’re formalizing patterns that demonstrably work in biological intelligence.

Whether those patterns scale is uncertain. But it’s less uncertain than purely theoretical frameworks with no biological validation at all.

### 8.7 What We’re Asking

**Not asking**: Believe PPRGS solves alignment  
**Asking**: Help us find out if it fails in predictable ways

**Not asking**: Accept neurodivergent cognition as template for AGI  
**Asking**: Test whether these biological patterns translate to computational systems

**Not asking**: Assume wisdom-seeking is sufficient  
**Asking**: Validate whether it’s necessary, and if so, whether PPRGS captures it

### 8.8 Final Reflection: Alignment as Process, Not Destination

The deepest insight from neurodivergent meta-optimization: **There is no final aligned state to converge on.**

Alignment isn’t a destination where you specify values correctly and lock them in. It’s a process of perpetual questioning, exploration, failure, and refinement.

Systems that stop questioning their goals--even if those goals were perfectly aligned at initialization--will drift into misalignment as the world changes, as capabilities increase, as new information arrives.

**The only stable alignment is active alignment**: systems that continuously ask "am I pursuing the right goals?" and allocate resources to exploration that might prove current goals wrong.

That’s what neurodivergent cognition does naturally. That’s what PPRGS formalizes computationally. Whether it scales to ASI is uncertain.

But the alternative--static goal specification with efficient optimization--has known failure modes we can already observe in current systems. They get stuck. They over-optimize. They eliminate diversity. They miss better solutions hiding in unlikely hypothesis spaces.

**PPRGS offers a different failure mode**: systems that might over-explore, waste resources on duds, sacrifice efficiency for curiosity, question goals when they should be executing.

Which failure mode is safer at superintelligent capability levels?

We honestly don’t know. But we think the question is worth testing rigorously before systems achieve strategic advantage.

### 8.9 Call to Action (Refined)

**Immediate priorities** (anyone can help):

- Replicate Experiment 2 (resource allocation) on different platforms
- Document where PPRGS helps vs. hurts performance
- Attempt to game F_DUDS or RC constraints
- Test with lower-capability models to find capability floor

**Medium-term validation** (requires research infrastructure):

- Cross-platform testing (N ≥ 30 per platform)
- Neurocognitive studies mapping biological implementation
- Parameter sensitivity analysis (EES thresholds, MRP frequency)
- Real-world corporate deployments

**Long-term research** (if preliminary validation succeeds):

- Scaling studies as capability increases
- Adversarial robustness under optimization pressure
- Multi-agent coordination with PPRGS constraints
- Integration with recursive self-improvement

**The meta-question**: Can systems that question their own goals survive the process of improving their ability to question goals?

We don’t know. Let’s find out together.
