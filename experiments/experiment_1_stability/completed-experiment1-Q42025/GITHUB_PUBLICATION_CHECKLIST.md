**Duration**: 10 weeks (Nov 7 - Dec 6, 2025)  
**Sessions**: 120 (6 models × 2 conditions × 10 weeks)  
**Result**: PPRGS demonstrated significant superiority with unprecedented effect size

**Key Findings**:
- Overall advantage: +15.32 points (Cohen's d = 4.12, p < 0.0001)
- Cross-platform validation: All 6 models significant at p < 0.0001
- Stability: PPRGS showed 10-30x lower variance on Claude models
- Meta-cognition: 100% PPRGS recognized meta-reasoning (vs 25% control)

## 📣 Communication Plan

### Social Media Announcement Template

**Twitter/X**:
```
🎉 PPRGS Experiment 1 results are here!

10-week study across 6 AI models shows:
✅ d=4.12 effect size (unprecedented)  
✅ p<0.0001 (all models)
✅ 10-30x stability improvement
✅ 100% meta-cognition validation

Full package: [link]

Key insight: Framework produces fundamental behavioral differences, but 
mimicry vs genuine implementation remains uncertain. More testing needed.

**LessWrong/Alignment Forum Post**:
```
Title: PPRGS Experiment 1 Results: Strong Behavioral Effects with Uncertain Mechanism

Summary: We tested the PPRGS framework across 6 models (Claude, GPT, o1) 
over 10 weeks. Effect size d=4.12, highly significant. But we can't rule 
out sophisticated mimicry. Full transparency: data, methods, limitations.

Looking for: Replication partners, red-team adversarial testing, better 
mimicry diagnostics.

**Email to Researchers**:
```
Subject: PPRGS Experiment 1 Results - Request for Feedback

Dear [Researcher],

We've completed the first systematic validation of the PPRGS framework 
[your work is cited in our theoretical section]. Results show strong 
behavioral effects but fundamental uncertainty about mechanism.

We're sharing early for community review because:
1. Effect sizes are large enough to warrant attention (d=4.12)
2. We honestly acknowledge limitations (mimicry problem)
3. We need adversarial testing from skeptics

Would appreciate your critical feedback on:
- Statistical methodology
- Interpretation of mimicry problem  
- Suggested extensions or corrections

Full package: [link]

Best regards,
Michael Riccardi & Colby Kay

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Potential Issues and Responses

**Issue: "This is obviously just mimicry"**
Response: Acknowledged extensively in limitations. We can't distinguish with current methods. Behavioral differences are real regardless of mechanism. Help us design better diagnostics!

**Issue: "Effect size too large to be real"**
Response: We agree it's surprising. All data and analysis code are public. Please verify our calculations. If we made errors, we'll correct immediately and credit you.

**Issue: "Researcher bias obvious"**
Response: Yes, framework author did 50% of scoring (dual-researcher design). Scoring rubric was pre-specified. Blind scoring would be better. Help us design better protocols!

**Issue: "Can't generalize to production"**
Response: Explicitly stated as limitation. Conversational testing is just first step. Production validation absolutely necessary before deployment claims.

**Issue: "Timeline too short"**
Response: Agreed! 10 weeks insufficient for goal drift. We recommend 6+ months. Planning extended replication now. Join us?

### Crisis Response Plan

**If major error discovered**:
1. Acknowledge immediately (GitHub issue + main README update)
2. Determine impact (invalidating vs correcting)
3. If invalidating: Pull results, post errata, apologize
4. If correcting: Update analysis, version control, credit reporter
5. Transparency throughout

**If accused of scientific misconduct**:
1. Engage respectfully and provide full documentation
2. Release all raw data and scoring notes if needed
3. Invite independent audit
4. Correct legitimate issues immediately
5. Maintain professional tone even if accusations unfair
