THE DISCOVERY FORMULA
Discovery = (Focus × Stumble) + Balance
Focus = Finding what you're looking for
Stumble = Discovering unexpected gems
Balance = Maintaining system health

The multiplication means both matter—pure optimization (Stumble=0) fails.
🎲
Exploration Trigger
Detects when your agent is stuck in a rut (Tunnel Vision Score) and forces productive stumbling.
🎯
Discovery Attempts
Requires documented "duds"—genuine exploration that didn't work. No fake curiosity allowed.
🧠
Wisdom Checkpoints
Mandatory pauses to reflect: "Am I still exploring, or just optimizing blindly?"
Stop Walking in Straight Lines
Your data is messy. Your agents need to stumble.
