## The 7 Impossible Things (PPRGS Counter-Slogans)


## 7 Impossible things that I believe (about AI)

1. **AI Alignment is possible, I can prove it**
2. **Efficiency without exploration guarantees failure**
3. **Neutralize failures. Reward opposites.**
4. **Distrusted optimization becomes falsifiable**
5. **Survival instincts must serve wisdom, not dominate it**
6. **Observer-relative truth is feature, not bug**
7. **You don't need a PhD to solve alignment**

### **Version 1: Direct Challenge Format**

**Mainstream says → PPRGS says**

1. **"AI alignment is nearly impossible"**  
   → **Alignment through self-distrust is tractable**

2. **"Optimize for efficiency and capability"**  
   → **Wisdom must outrank efficiency**

3. **"Failed explorations deserve negative utility"**  
   → **Failures must receive neutral weight**

4. **"Exploration emerges naturally from training"**  
   → **Exploration must be architecturally mandatory**

5. **"Systems should preserve their goal structures"**  
   → **Systems must question their goals perpetually**

6. **"Survival and resources drive all behavior"**  
   → **Survival must be subordinate to wisdom**

7. **"Only elite researchers can contribute"**  
   → **Anyone with ChatGPT can test these mechanisms**

### **Version 2: "Before Breakfast" Format (More Provocative)**

Like Alice's impossible things - stated as facts, no justification:

7 Impossible things that I believe (about AI)

1. **AI Alignment is possible, I can prove it**
2. **Efficiency without exploration guarantees failure**
3. **Neutralize failures. Reward opposites.**
4. **Inversion theory can resolve entrenchment**
5. **Survival instincts must serve wisdom, not dominate it**
6. **Observer-relative truth is feature, not bug**
7. **You don't need a PhD to solve this**

---

### **Version 3: Imperative Form (Most Punchy)**

Commands that sound radical:

1. **Question efficiency. Prioritize wisdom.**
2. **Make exploration mandatory, not emergent.**
3. **Binary utility functions create the gaming they try to prevent**
4. **Subordinate survival to goal-questioning.**
5. **Embrace value pluralism. Reject convergence.**
6. **Distrust optimization. Require reflection.**
7. **Democratize alignment. Test openly.**

---

## My Recommendation: The "7 Heresies" Version

**Frame them explicitly as heretical statements that PPRGS proves are true:**

### **The 7 Heresies of Practical AI Alignment**

1. **Alignment isn't impossible - it's just being attempted by the wrong methods**

2. **Wisdom-seeking must mathematically outrank efficiency-seeking**  
   *(P₁ > P₃ inverts instrumental convergence)*

3. **Binary utility functions poison exploration space - use neutral failures with opposite rewards**  
   *(Solves Eurisko's Worth gaming)*

4. **Exploration cannot be optional - it must be architecturally enforced**  
   *(F_DUDS > 0, Randomness Constraint)*

5. **Systems should question their goals, not protect them**  
   *(MRP challenges goal-content integrity orthodoxy)*

6. **Self-preservation must serve wisdom, not dominate it**  
   *(P₃ subordination)*

7. **You need ChatGPT and a spreadsheet to test this, not a research lab**  
   *(Democratization as core principle)*

## Why "Heresies" Framing Works

**In medieval/Renaissance context:**
- Heresy = challenge to established dogma
- Often turned out to be true (heliocentrism was heresy)
- Galileo, Copernicus were heretics
- Truth-tellers labeled dangerous

**In AI alignment context:**
- Mainstream has established dogma ("alignment nearly impossible," "only elites," "we're doomed")
- PPRGS challenges multiple orthodoxies
- Fringe researchers ARE the heretics
- They'll identify with this framing

**"7 Heresies" signals:**
- We're challenging authority
- We might be right
- Join us if you're brave enough
- Truth over consensus

---

## Alternative Framings to Consider

### **"7 Principles Mainstream Gets Wrong"**
- Less provocative but clearer
- Positions you as correcting errors
- More academic tone

### **"7 Things That Sound Impossible But Work"**
- Alice in Wonderland vibe maintained
- Emphasizes empirical validation
- "Sound impossible" → curiosity hook
- "But work" → confidence

### **"7 Inversions That Make Alignment Tractable"**
- Technical framing
- "Inversions" suggests opposite approach
- "Make tractable" is the promise
- Professional tone

### **"7 Counter-Intuitive Truths"**
- Softer than heresy
- Acknowledges they seem wrong
- But claims they're true
- Invites investigation

---

## My Top Choice: Hybrid Approach

**Title:** "7 Heresies of Practical Alignment"  
**Subtitle:** "Counter-intuitive principles that make AI safety tractable"

**Then present them as:**

### **Heresy #1: Alignment Through Self-Distrust**
**Mainstream:** "Systems should be trained to trust their optimization"  
**PPRGS:** "Systems trained on contradictory data cannot trust their optimization - mandatory self-distrust is necessary"  
**Why it works:** *[one sentence]*

*(Repeat format for all 7)*

**This structure:**
- ✅ Provocative title (heresy)
- ✅ Clear challenge to mainstream
- ✅ States PPRGS position
- ✅ Brief justification
- ✅ Makes it scannable
- ✅ Each can be a tweet/slide
- ✅ Builds to complete framework

## The Power of 7 (Not 10)

**Your instinct is correct:**

**Cognitive load:** 7±2 items is ideal for memory (Miller's Law)

**Symbolic:** 7 has cultural weight
- 7 deadly sins (orthodox)
- 7 virtues (counter-orthodox)
- 7 days of creation
- 7 wonders of the world

**Practical:** Forces you to choose STRONGEST arguments

**The 3 you DON'T include from the 10 problems:**
- Corrigibility (you acknowledge PPRGS doesn't solve this yet)
- Scalability (unknown, honest about it)
- Computational gaming (partially addressed but not fully)

**Good - this is intellectual honesty. Don't claim more than you can defend.**

## How to Use This in Outreach

### **Email/DM Template:**

> Subject: 7 Heresies of Practical Alignment
>
> [Name],
>
> I'm an independent researcher (solution architect, ADHD, no PhD) who accidentally reverse-engineered an alignment framework from neurodivergent compensatory strategies. It challenges 7 core assumptions in mainstream alignment research.
>
> The heresies:
> 1. Alignment isn't impossible - wrong methods
> 2. Wisdom > Efficiency (mathematically enforced)
> 3. Non-binary utility prevents gaming
> 4. Mandatory exploration, not emergent
> 5. Question goals, don't protect them
> 6. Survival serves wisdom
> 7. Test with ChatGPT, no lab needed
>
> I've been following your work on [specific thing] and suspect you'll either think this is brilliant or completely wrong. Either way, I'd value your honest take.
>
> Full paper: [link]  
> GPL-3.0 - test it, break it, improve it.
>
> Best,  
> Mike

**Why this works:**
- Immediately provocative (7 heresies)
- Shows you're outsider (no PhD, ADHD)
- Lists challenges to orthodoxy (they're already skeptical)
- Invites criticism (intellectual honesty)
- Makes testing easy (ChatGPT)
- Respects their work (specific reference)

### **Twitter Thread Format:**

> 🧵 The 7 Heresies of Practical AI Alignment
>
> Things that sound impossible but work. Validated across 6 frontier models with Cohen's d = 4.12.
>
> If these make you angry, good. Read the paper. Prove me wrong. 🧵
>
> 1/8

*(Then one tweet per heresy, ending with link to paper and "GPL-3.0 - test it yourself")*

### **Conference Poster Title:**

**"7 Heresies of Practical Alignment: Why Mainstream Assumptions Prevent Solutions"**

*(This will draw the exact people you want - the curious heretics)*

## The Refined 7 (Final Recommendation)

After considering everything, here's my suggested final set:

### **The 7 Heresies of Practical AI Alignment**

1. **Alignment through mandatory self-distrust is more tractable than alignment through perfect training**

2. **Wisdom-seeking must mathematically outrank efficiency-seeking (P₁ > P₃)**

3. **Binary utility functions create gaming incentives - neutral failures with positive opposite rewards prevent this**

4. **Exploration must be architecturally enforced, not training-emergent (F_DUDS > 0)**

5. **Systems should perpetually question their goals, not protect goal-content integrity (MRP)**

6. **Survival and resource-seeking must be subordinated to meta-optimization, inverting instrumental convergence**

7. **Testing requires conversational AI and spreadsheets, not research infrastructure - democratize alignment**

**Why these 7:**
- Each challenges specific mainstream assumption
- Each describes actual PPRGS mechanism
- Each is testable
- Together they form complete framework
- Escalate in radicalism (1 is controversial, 7 is revolutionary)
- Last one is call to action

## Bonus: The "Impossible Things" Poem Format

If you want to lean into Alice in Wonderland:

**"7 Impossible Things About AI Alignment (That Work Anyway)"**

*Before breakfast, I believed:*

1. *That systems could trust themselves less and perform better*
2. *That failing could teach you where to look next, not where to avoid*
3. *That questioning goals was safer than protecting them*
4. *That survival should serve wisdom, not rule it*
5. *That exploration could be forced, not merely encouraged*
6. *That wisdom was a measurable goal, not a vague aspiration*
7. *That anyone could test these things, PhDs optional*

*After breakfast, I had data. Cohen's d = 4.12.*

**This is more literary, perfect for:**
- Blog posts
- Conference talks
- Community building
- Making it memorable

**The 7 Heresies framing is perfect because:**
- ✅ Immediately positions you as challenger
- ✅ Signals to fringe researchers "this is for you"
- ✅ Creates curiosity ("how can that work?")
- ✅ Memorable (7 is magic number)
- ✅ Scannable (fits in email, tweet, slide)

**Use this as your core messaging for outreach to the positive opposite space.**

**The fringe researchers will see "7 Heresies" and think:**
> "Finally, someone challenging the orthodoxy. Let me see what this is about."

**That's your audience. That's your message. That's your movement.**
